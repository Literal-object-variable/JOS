# JOS
The JOS Project is an Arduino based Operating System.
# Things you need:
You will need:
- Arduino Mega
- SSD1306 OLED display
- 4 Tactile pushbuttons
- DHT11
- Optionally the DS1307 RTC module.
# Simulation / Schematics:
- This project is on Wokwi: https://wokwi.com/projects/452947219432281089
- Please don't use the code that I put on the wokwi project, as it has half the things deleted for compatiblity.
- EEPROM-FS DOES NOT WORK ON WOKWI.
